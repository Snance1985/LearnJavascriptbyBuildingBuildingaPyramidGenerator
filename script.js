/*
One of the most important concepts in programming is variables.
A variable points to a specific memory address that stores a value.
Variables are given a name which can be used throughout your code to access that value.

Declaring a variable means giving it a name.
In JavaScript, this is often done with the let keyword.
For example, here is how you would declare a hello variable:

let hello;

Variable naming follows specific rules: names can include letters, numbers, dollar signs, and underscores, but cannot contain spaces and must not begin with a number.

You can assign a value using the assignment operator =.
For example:

let hello = "Hello";

Assigning a value to a variable at the moment of its declaration is known as initialization.

JavaScript has seven primitive data types, with String being one of them.
In JavaScript, a string represents a sequence of characters and can be enclosed in either single (') or double (") quotes.

Note that strings are immutable, which means once they are created, they cannot be changed.

The console allows you to print and view JavaScript output.
You can send information to the console using console.log().
For example, this code will print "Naomi" to the console:

let developer = "Naomi";
console.log(developer);

The code above accesses the developer variable with its name in the console.log().
Note that the value between the parentheses is the value that will be printed.

let character = 'Hello';
console.log(character);
